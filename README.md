# Entity Component System - Data Oriented Programming

This is a rehash of the old but excellent article by Erik Hazzard on ECS and data driven design found [here](http://vasir.net/blog/game-development/how-to-build-entity-component-system-in-javascript).

Except instead of writing it in JavaScript, I'm using Lua and rendering through [LÃ–VE2D](https://love2d.org/).

Currently, this is just something I'm looking into out of interest. As a (mostly) web/mobile dev exploring gaming programming, I'm interested in the code structure concepts, so why not hey!
